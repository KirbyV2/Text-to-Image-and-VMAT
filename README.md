# Text-to-Image-and-VMAT

Text to Image and VMAT is a Python-based utility designed to automate the creation of text textures for Counter-Strike 2 (Source 2 Hammer). Featuring a unified dark-themed GUI consistent with the Texture Layer Generator, this tool allows users to render custom text with precise control over fonts, alignment, padding, and outline effects. It streamlines the mapping workflow by exporting color (_color) and transparency (_trans) maps alongside auto-generated .vmat files compatible with csgo_static_overlay and csgo_complex shaders. Additional features include a cached system font selector, live threaded previews, and a batch mode for quickly generating numeric sequences (0-9).
